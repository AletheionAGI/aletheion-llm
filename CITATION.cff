title: "Aletheion: Epistemic Uncertainty for Large Language Models"
abstract: "Implementation of fractally-applied epistemic softmax for calibrated, uncertainty-aware language models. Aletheion addresses hallucination and overconfidence in large language models by replacing softmax operations with epistemic softmax—a gating mechanism that factors uncertainty into every decision."
