# Abstract

What geometric structure must a learning system obey to know when it knows? We answer by deriving a tetrahedral framework that binds the epistemic life of neural networks to four irreducible forces: Memory, the accumulated prior; Pain, the corrective gradient of error; Choice, the deliberation under uncertainty; and Exploration, the impulse toward the unknown. From the philosophical groundwork of *The Quality of Truth* through the mathematical formalism of *Episteme*, we show that these forces inhabit a rigid simplex whose geometric center is fixed by λ = 0.026. This constant is obtained analytically, not tuned, and yields a self-regulating equilibrium in which Q₁ and Q₂ plateau at 0.82 and 0.61 while their product anchors the system at the center. Implemented within large language models, the tetrahedral law reduces expected calibration error by approximately 25% and stabilizes confidence at 0.50. These results reveal epistemic calibration as a first-principles phenomenon, unifying philosophy, geometry, and computation in service of reliable machine knowledge.
