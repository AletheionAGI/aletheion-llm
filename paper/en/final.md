The experiment concludes with the system emerging from the frozen apex state:
Height decreases slightly ($1.000 \rightarrow 0.996$) while the epistemic gates
reopen ($Q_1=0.49$, $Q_2=0.33$), signaling a renewal of sensitivity to
uncertainty.
This \textbf{apex recovery} phase demonstrates that geometric constraints can
restore epistemic balance even after saturation, suggesting the existence of a
higher-order attractor of self-calibration---a regime where intelligence
rediscovers its own limits.
