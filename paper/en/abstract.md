Aletheion: Fractal Epistemic Architecture for Large Language Models
==================================================================

Large language models (LLMs) remain prone to hallucination, inconsistency, and sycophancy because their decoding stack treats uncertainty as a nuisance rather than a first-class signal. We argue that the ubiquitous softmax operator is the root cause: it enforces a normalized distribution even when the latent representation contains no evidence for any hypothesis. We introduce epistemic softmax, a drop-in replacement that decomposes predictive confidence into four interacting components—local uncertainty (Q₁), cross-context consensus (Q₂), variance-adjusted ranking optimization (VARO), and an exploration controller. Applied fractally to every softmax instance in the transformer pipeline, epistemic softmax produces uncertainty-aware attention, gating, and output distributions. We formalize the resulting architecture, Aletheion, and outline a staged implementation roadmap spanning output-only adoption to full-stack integration. Our theoretical analysis shows how epistemic signals propagate hierarchically and why they mitigate five prevalent failure modes of LLMs: hallucination, inconsistency, sycophancy, prompt brittleness, and the inability to express doubt. We further specify the VARO training objective that aligns predictive entropy with ground-truth ambiguity, discuss complexity overhead, and present an experimental blueprint covering calibration, hallucination detection, and ablations. While empirical validation is ongoing, Aletheion reframes uncertainty modeling as an architectural primitive rather than a post-hoc patch, enabling language models that know when they do not know.
