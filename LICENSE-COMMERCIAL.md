Non-commercial use (e.g., personal, educational, research, or internal evaluation) is permitted without payment.

Optional support, updates, and service-level agreements may be provided by the Licensor under separate commercial terms.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 7. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LICENSOR'S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATED TO THIS LICENSE IS LIMITED TO THE FEES PAID BY LICENSEE FOR THE SOFTWARE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

## 8. Term and Termination
This license remains in effect until terminated. Licensor may terminate the license immediately upon written notice if Licensee breaches any material term of this agreement, including failure to pay required fees.  
Upon termination, Licensee must cease all use of the Software and destroy all copies within thirty (30) days.
